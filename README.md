# media-backlog-tracker

Hi, this is my media backlog tracker! 

The goal of this project is to have a media backlog tracker I can use every day. It is primarily made to track videogames, but it will have support for other media in the future, such as movies and TV shows.

It also serves as a learning experience for me to build a full-stack application with test-driven development and version control. 

# Current stack
- Frontend - HTML, JavaScript (to move to React + TypeScript)
- Backend - TypeScript
- Server - Fastify
- Testing - Vitest
